# Starship Game

A simple 2D starship game developed using Rust and the Bevy game engine.

## Features

- **Move the Ship**: Control the ship using arrow keys.
- **Mouse Rotation**: Rotate the ship towards the mouse pointer when clicked.
- **Collision Detection**: The ship triggers an explosion (fireball) when it collides with boxes.
- **Randomly Moving Boxes**: Boxes move randomly across the screen, creating obstacles.
- **Start and End Points**: The ship starts at a defined point and moves towards the end point.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to move the ship around the screen.
2. Click on the screen to rotate the ship towards the mouse pointer.
3. Avoid colliding with the moving boxes to prevent triggering an explosion.
